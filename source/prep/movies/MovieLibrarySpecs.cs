    /* The following set of Context/Specification pairs are in place to specify the functionality that you need to complete for the MovieLibrary class.
   * MovieLibrary is an collection of Movie. It exposes the ability to search,sort, and iterate over all of the movies that it contains.
   * The current implementation of MovieLibrary has almost all of its methods throwing a NotImplementedException. Your job is to get all of the Contexts and their
   * accompanying specifications [tests] passing
   * 
   * This exercise will give you an opportunity to get some familiarity with the following contracts:
   * 
   *      -IEnumerable<T> - The Grandfather of all collection interfaces
   *      -IList<T>
   *      -IEquatable<T>
   *      -IComparer<T>
   *      -Comparison<T> delegate type
   *      -Predicate<T> delegate type
   *      -Generics     
   * 
   * The primary goals of this exercise are to get you familiar with a couple of things:
   *      Unit Testing Framework (Machine.Specification)
   *      BDD Style Test Naming Syntax
   *      Fluent Assertions - You will find most of these are extension methods that start with the name Should[NAME]
   *      Refactoring
   *      Core collection interfaces and types
   *      Encapsulation
   *      
   * The main purpose of the exercise is to give you practical exposure to some fundamental design principles that will
   * become more important as the week progresses
   * 
   *      Single Responsiblity Principle
   *      Open Closed Principle
   *      Tell Don't Ask 
   *      Code to contracts not implementations
   *      Favour Composition over inheritance
   *      
   *
   * The tests are complete. You will just need to get the implementation working. 
   * 
   * 
   * ************** RESTRICTIONS **************************************************************************************
   * No linq allowed - this is to force some interesting design problems to the surface
   * You can only change the code in the following classes:
   *          - Movie
   *          - MovieLibrary
   *          
   * If you have any questions please do not hesitate to email me at jp@developwithpassion.com
   * Or give me a call at (503)213-3507
